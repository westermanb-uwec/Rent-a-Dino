                <p>
                    Rent-a-Dino offers a variety of services that include birthday party visits, circus performances, dinosaur rentals, and training of service dinosaurs. Rent-a-Dino also 
                    offers sales of micro-dinos and our exclusive frienosaurs. This is all thanks to our partnership with daddy Musk that provided the technology that brings these dinosaurs back 
                    into our worlds.

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our company follows a internally created philosophy of Irwinism. This philosophy is based on the mentality of Steve Irwin. Essentially
                we value the connection humans have with all wildlife and it is our mission to allow humans to fully embrace and understand dinosaurs.
                The goal of the company is to bring the love of all wildlife to our younger generation even those that are deemed some of the most hostile.
